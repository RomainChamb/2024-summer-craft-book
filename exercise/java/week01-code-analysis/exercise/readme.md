### Exercise 1: First things first

You are about to look at a pretty complicated and big code base. Be prepared to look at the big picture before nitpicking every single details you come across.

What do you see? 

>**Write down all the things you would change and prefix them with a number.**

Note: For this exercise, we recommend using the summer book but if you are using only the coding version, feel free to have your own notepad or put TODO comments in the code. It's important that you index them for the part 2 and 3.

### Exercise 2: Arrange by type.

Use the numbers on each smell to arrange them in three categories:

CS: Code smells
I: Improvements
V: Vulnerabilities

If you are using only the coding version, prefix your TODOs with the code.

### Exercise 3: Use your own category.

You may use another system to prefix the TODOs in your code. Use your own category that seems better for you.
