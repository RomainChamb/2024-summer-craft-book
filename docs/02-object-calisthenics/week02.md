## Week 2: Object Calisthenics.

> Let's look at the steps needed to read better code

### The concepts

9 Steps to improve code readibility

Object Calisthenics are a set of principles intended to help developers write cleaner, more maintainable code. They were introduced by Jeff Bay in his book "The ThoughtWorks Anthology". The rules focus on maintaining simplicity and clarity in code design. They are as stated below:

   1) Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
   2) Don’t Use The ELSE Keyword
   3) Wrap All Primitives And Strings
   4) First Class Collections
   5) One Dot Per Line
   6) Don’t Abbreviate
   7) Keep All Entities Small
   8) No Classes With More Than 2 Instance Variables
   9) No Getters/Setters/Properties
