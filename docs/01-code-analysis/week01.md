## Week 1: Code Analysis.

> “Most, if not all developers spend their day reading codes”

### Daily job

As developers, we spend a lot of time reading code (some research suggest about 2/3 or our time), and as such, we polished our own set of tools to be able to navigate the intricate nature of the several code base we work on.

```java
     val ret = false;  //the value is always false
     return ret;
```

### Psychological bias

We have also developed bias towards reading codes especially code that is not ours. The first week will be spent reading a huge code base and analyzing the code. 

Reading objectively and not taking immediate actions can be the key to safe refactoring.

### Exercise 1: First things first

You are about to look at a pretty complicated and big code base. Be prepared to look at the big picture before nitpicking every single details you come across.

What do you see? 

>**Write down all the things you would change and prefix them with a number.**

Note: For this exercise, we recommend using the summer book but if you are using only the coding version, feel free to have your own notepad or put TODO comments in the code. It's important that you index them for the part 2 and 3.

### Exercise 2: Arrange by type.

Use the numbers on each smell to arrange them in three categories:

CS: Code smells
I: Improvements
V: Vulnerabilities

If you are using only the coding version, prefix your TODOs with the code.

### Exercise 3: Use your own category.

You may use another system to prefix the TODOs in your code. Use your own category that seems better for you.

### Go further

Taking notes as mind-map is a powerful tool to help remember information in a structured way. Here is an example of notes for code analysis.
