## Week 2: Object Calisthenics.

> Let's look at the steps needed to read better code

### The concepts

9 Steps to improve code readibility

Object Calisthenics are a set of principles intended to help developers write cleaner, more maintainable code. They were introduced by Jeff Bay in his book "The ThoughtWorks Anthology". The rules focus on maintaining simplicity and clarity in code design. They are as stated below:

   1) Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
   2) Don’t Use The ELSE Keyword
   3) Wrap All Primitives And Strings
   4) First Class Collections
   5) One Dot Per Line
   6) Don’t Abbreviate
   7) Keep All Entities Small
   8) No Classes With More Than 2 Instance Variables
   9) No Getters/Setters/Properties

As illustrated in this [article](https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/)

### Reflexion

Which one do you agree and disagree and why? 
Write down your observation about the steps above by your own experience

### Exercise 1: Fight Indentation

Over indentation is at the core of accidental complexity. 
The first thing you have to religiously go through is to avoid unnecessary indentation level.

### Exercise 2: Identify the steps

Identify the Object Calisthenics steps in the code below? 

A little reminder:
   1) Only One Level Of Indentation
   2) Don’t Use The ELSE Keyword
   3) Wrap All Primitives And Strings
   4) First Class Collections
   5) One Dot Per Line
   6) Don’t Abbreviate
   7) Keep All Entities Small
   8) No More Than 2 Invariants per class
   9) No Getters/Setters/Properties


>**Write a TODO to where it is in the code that does not respect a step, mark which step it is and the action you would do.**

Feel free to correct the code as you see fit.
